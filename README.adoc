Start with an explanation why the guide is important.

[source,]
----
# bad
This Ruby style guide contains best practices for programming Ruby.

# good
This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby programmers.
----

=== Essentials

Leave out obvious, rarely used, and arguable recommendations.

[source,]
----
# bad
Do not keep newlines in the beginning of the file.

# good
End each file with a single newline.
----

=== Descriptive Section Titles

=== Meaningful Descriptions

Provide concise, but comprehensive descriptions.

[source,]
----
# bad - not enough context
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.

# bad - excessively verbose
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes are intended to be instantiated and inherited from. A
A service class is usually a functional unit that has an entry point, and the implementation is not important for consumers.
Dealing with the redundant necessity to instantiate a service class adds boilerplate to consumer code.

# good
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes should be used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.
----

=== Good, Ok'ish and Bad Examples

==== Example Description

Provide example description if the example is not obvious.

[source,]
----
# bad - too verbose
...

# ok'ish - short, but comprehensive
...

# good - enough context to understand the implications
...
----

=== Options

Provide options when there is more than one acceptable way.

=== Context

Provide necessary context, sources, links to discussions.

=== Up to Date

Keep the guide up to date.
Do not keep obsolete guidelines just for historical reasons.

=== Regarded Sources

Iconic books on the subject of the guide are the best source of guidelines.

Established practices is another.
Consult popular source code of mature projects, e.g. https://github.com/jeromedalbert/real-world-ruby-apps/[Real World Ruby apps] and https://github.com/eliotsykes/real-world-rails/[Real World Rails apps].
Make sure to use recent stable versions.

=== External Content

Do not rely on external content.
Keep important information in the guide itself.

=== Keep it Tidy

It's ok to have discussions in progress.
However, if there's no consensus, and discussions lead nowhere, close the pull request/issue.

== Layout

=== Provide the Table of Contents [[provide-toc]]

=== Group the Guidelines

Group the guidelines into logically related sections.

=== Order Guidelines by Importance

=== Brothership

In doubt, consult and mimic the other guides.

== Formatting

=== Use proper English

=== Use proper AsciiDoc

Refer to the latest https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices[AsciiDoc recommended practices].
Check HTML and PDF export output before accepting a change.

=== Code in Section Titles

Quote code with backslashes in section titles

=== Section Title Case

Section titles should normally adhere to title case.

[source,]
----
# bad
=== Section title case

# good
=== Section Title Case
----

=== Explicit Section Anchors

    good for renaming
    primary/secondary

=== One Sentence per Line [[ventilated-prose]] [[one-sentence-per-line]]

https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line
    less churn
    three examples

=== Quote Code in Section Titles

[source,]
----
# bad
=== No and or or [[no-and-or-or]]

# good
=== No `and` or `or` [[no-and-or-or]]
----

==== Except when it's Unnecessary

[source,]
----
# ok'ish
=== `Set` vs `Array`

# good
=== Set vs Array
----

== Misc

=== Commnunity

Make it clear that the guide is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to contribute and discuss.

=== Evolution

=== Static Analysis Tool References

Provide a reference to corresponding `rubocop-hq/*` RuboCop extension, if it exists.

=== Tell How to Contribute

=== Advertize

Ask to spread the word about the guide.
A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that doesn't know about its existence.

=== Add a License

  include .gitattributes file with no-trailing whitespace, no-something

=== Ignore Produced Export

include .gitignore
