This Meta style guide outlines the recommended practices for style guide contributors.
When we say "style", we mean "consistency".

== Content

____
Content is King

-- Bill Gates
____

=== Start with Why [[start-with-why]]

____
People don't buy what you do,
they buy why you do it.

-- Simon Sinek
____

Start with an explanation why the guide is important.

....
# bad
This Ruby style guide contains best practices for programming Ruby.

# good
This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby programmers.
....

=== Essentials

Leave out obvious, rarely used, and arguable guidelines.

....
# bad
Do not keep newlines in the beginning of the file.

# good
End each file with a single newline.
....

=== Descriptive Section Titles

Provide a descriptive and concise section title.
Avoid long titles.

....
# bad - hard to understand the point, too generic
=== Section Titles

# bad - overly verbose
=== Explanatory and Descriptive Section Titles

# good
=== Descriptive Section Titles
....

=== Meaningful Descriptions

Provide concise, but comprehensive description.

....
# bad - not enough context
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.

# bad - excessively verbose
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes are intended to be instantiated and inherited from.
A service class is usually a functional unit that has an entry point, and the implementation is not important for consumers.
Dealing with the redundant necessity to instantiate a service class adds boilerplate to consumer code.

# good
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes should be used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.
....

=== Good, OK'ish and Bad Examples

Provide good, and bad examples for the guideline.
Give enough context, but keep to the point.

==== Good Bad Examples

Don't make a bad example horrible.
Let it adhere to the other guidelines to highlight how it breaks the guideline in question.

....
# bad bad - bad by all means
==== Secktion taitl case

# good bad - just bad from title case standpoint
==== Section title case [[section-title-case]]
....

==== Example Description

Provide example description if the example is not obvious.

....
# bad - too verbose
...

# ok'ish - short, but comprehensive
...

# good - enough context to understand the implications
...
....

=== Options

Provide options when there is more than one acceptable way.

....
# good
=== Consistent Multi-line Chains [[consistent-multi-line-chains]]

Adopt a consistent multi-line method chaining style.
There are two popular styles in the Ruby community, both of which are considered good - leading `.`  and trailing `.`.

==== Leading `.` [[leading-dot-in-multi-line-chains]]

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line keep the `.` on the second line.

==== Trailing `.` [[trailing-dot-in-multi-line-chains]]

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line, include the `.` on the first line to indicate that the expression continues.
....

=== Context

Provide necessary context, sources, links to discussions.

=== Up to Date

Keep the guide up to date.
Do not keep obsolete guidelines just for historical reasons.

=== Regarded Sources

Iconic books on the subject of the guide are the best source of guidelines.

Established practices is another.
Consult popular source code of mature projects, e.g. https://github.com/jeromedalbert/real-world-ruby-apps/[Real World Ruby apps] and https://github.com/eliotsykes/real-world-rails/[Real World Rails apps].
Make sure to use recent stable versions.

=== External Content

Do not rely on external content.
Keep important information in the guide itself.

....
# bad
Refer to https://www.geocities.com/ironhorse/ruby-multi-line-chains.html[this blog post] for more information.

# good
Leading dot style may result in surprising behavior when the code is pasted in IRB.
....

=== Keep it Tidy

It's OK to have discussions in progress.
However, if there's no consensus, and discussions lead nowhere, close the pull request/issue.
Probably it's not something super important.
It's unlikely that it will ever be handled.

== Layout

=== Provide the Table of Contents [[provide-toc]]

=== Group the Guidelines

Group the guidelines into logically related sections.

=== Order Guidelines by Importance

=== Cooperation

In doubt, consult and mimic the other guides.

== Formatting and Wording

=== Use Proper Terms

....
# bad
Recommendation


# good
Guideline
....

=== Use Proper English

=== Use Proper AsciiDoc

Refer to the latest https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices[AsciiDoc recommended practices].
Check HTML and PDF export output before accepting a change.

=== Code in Section Titles

Quote code with backslashes in section titles

=== Section Title Case

Section titles should normally adhere to title case.

....
# bad - not all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs are capitalized
=== Provide the table of contents [[provide-toc]]

# bad - conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are capitalized
=== Provide The Table If Contents [[provide-toc]]

# good
=== Provide the Table of Contents [[provide-toc]]
....

=== Explicit Section Anchors

    good for renaming
    primary/secondary

=== One Sentence per Line [[ventilated-prose]] [[one-sentence-per-line]]

https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line
    less churn
    three examples

=== Quote Code in Section Titles

....
# bad
=== No and or or [[no-and-or-or]]

# good
=== No `and` or `or` [[no-and-or-or]]
....

==== Except when it's Unnecessary

....
# ok'ish
=== `Set` vs `Array`

# good
=== Set vs Array
....

=== Use ASCII [[use-ascii]]

Stick to ASCII character set unless absolutely necessary.

....
# bad
It’s “typographically” correct.

# good
It's "typographically" incorrect.
....

== Misc

=== Commnunity

Make it clear that the guide is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to contribute and discuss.

=== Evolution

Mention that the guide is not set in stone, and is a living document.

=== Static Analysis Tool References

Provide a reference to corresponding `rubocop-hq/*` RuboCop extension, if it exists.

=== Tell How to Contribute

=== Advertise

Ask to spread the word about the guide.
A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that doesn't know about its existence.

=== Add a License

=== Provide Editor Configuration File

  include .gitattributes file with no-trailing whitespace, no-something

=== Ignore Produced Export

include .gitignore
