This Meta style guide outlines the recommended practices for style guide contributors.
When we say "style", we mean "consistency".

[#content]
== Content

____
Content is King

-- Bill Gates
____

[#start-with-why]
=== Start with Why

____
People don't buy what you do,
they buy why you do it.

-- Simon Sinek
____

Start with an explanation why the guide is important.

....
# bad
This Ruby style guide contains best practices for programming Ruby.

# good
This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby programmers.
....

[#essentials]
=== Essentials

Leave out obvious, rarely used, and arguable guidelines.

....
# bad
Do not keep newlines in the beginning of the file.

# good
End each file with a single newline.
....

[#descriptive-section-titles]
=== Descriptive Section Titles

Provide a descriptive and concise section title.
Avoid long titles.

....
# bad - hard to understand the point, too generic
=== Section Titles

# bad - overly verbose
=== Explanatory and Descriptive Section Titles

# good
=== Descriptive Section Titles
....

[#meaningful-descriptions]
=== Meaningful Descriptions

Provide a concise, but comprehensive description.

....
# bad - not enough context
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.

# bad - excessively verbose
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes are intended to be instantiated and inherited from.
A service class is usually a functional unit that has an entry point, and the implementation is not important for consumers.
Dealing with the redundant necessity to instantiate a service class adds boilerplate to consumer code.

# good
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes should be used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.
....

[#good-okish-and-bad-examples]
=== Good, OK'ish and Bad Examples

Provide good and bad examples for the guideline.
Give enough context, but keep to the point.

Feel free to add tolerable examples.

....
# bad
class FooError < StandardError
end

# ok'ish
class FooError < StandardError; end

# good
FooError = Class.new(StandardError)
....

[#good-bad-examples]
==== Good Bad Examples

Don't make a bad example horrible.
Let it adhere to the other guidelines to highlight how it breaks the guideline in question.

....
# bad bad - bad by all means
%w$%d %d$ % \
  [20,10]

# good bad - just bad from current guideline standpoint
'%d %d' % [20, 10]
....

[#example-annotation]
==== Example Annotation

Provide example annotation if the example is not obvious.

....
# bad - too verbose
...

# ok'ish - short, but comprehensive
...

# good - enough context to understand the implications
...
....

[#options]
=== Options

Provide options when there is more than one acceptable way.

....
# good
[#consistent-multi-line-chains]
=== Consistent Multi-line Chains

Adopt a consistent multi-line method chaining style.
There are two popular styles in the Ruby community, both of which are considered good - leading `.`  and trailing `.`.

[#leading-dot-in-multi-line-chains]
==== Leading `.`

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line keep the `.` on the second line.

[#trailing-dot-in-multi-line-chains]
==== Trailing `.`

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line, include the `.` on the first line to indicate that the expression continues.
....

[#context]
=== Context

Provide necessary context, sources, links to discussions.

[#up-to-date]
=== Up to Date

Keep the guide up to date.
Do not keep obsolete guidelines just for historical reasons.

[#regarded-sources]
=== Regarded Sources

Iconic books on the subject of the guide are the best source of guidelines.

Established practices is another.
Consult popular source code of mature projects, e.g. https://github.com/jeromedalbert/real-world-ruby-apps/[Real World Ruby apps] and https://github.com/eliotsykes/real-world-rails/[Real World Rails apps].
Make sure to use recent stable versions.

[#external-content]
=== External Content

Do not rely on external content.
Keep important information in the guide itself.

....
# bad
Refer to https://www.geocities.com/ironhorse/ruby-multi-line-chains.html[this blog post] for more information.

# good
Leading dot style may result in surprising behavior when the code is pasted in IRB.
....

[#keep-it-tidy]
=== Keep it Tidy

It's OK to have discussions in progress.
However, if there's no consensus, and discussions lead nowhere, close the pull request/issue.
Probably it's not something super important.
It's unlikely that it will ever be handled.

== Layout

[#group-the-guidelines]
=== Group the Guidelines

Group the guidelines into logically related sections by defining group sections using level 1 section titles.

[#order-by-importance]
=== Order by Importance

Put the most important guidelines on the top of the groups.

[#provide-toc]
=== Provide the Table of Contents

Make sure the table of contents provides links to guideline groups, and important topics by defining them level 1 section titles.

....
# good - "Syntax" is available in the table of contents
== Syntax

[#double-colons]
=== Double colons
....

[#cooperation]
=== Cooperation

In doubt, consult and mimic the other guides.

[#formatting-and-wording]
== Formatting and Wording

[#user-proper-terms]
=== Use Proper Terms

Avoid uncommon slang, call things what they are, and what community calls them.

....
# bad
Do not use nested method definitions, use a closure instead.

# good
Do not use nested method definitions, use lambda instead.
....

[#use-proper-english]
=== Use Proper English

Avoid grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors.

[#use-proper-asciidoc]
=== Use Proper AsciiDoc

Refer to the latest https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices[AsciiDoc recommended practices].
Check HTML and PDF export output before accepting a change.

[#section-title-case]
=== Section Title Case

Section titles should normally adhere to title case.

....
# bad - not all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs are capitalized
=== Provide the table of contents

# bad - conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are capitalized
=== Provide The Table If Contents

# good
=== Provide the Table of Contents
....

[#explicit-section-anchors]
=== Explicit Section Anchors

To keep links from external resources working, provide an explicit primary section id.
It us used as an anchor. When the section title changes, keep the old id as a secondary, or tertiary id.

....
# good
[#section-title]
=== Section Title

# good - old anchor is kept
[#new-section-title]
=== New Section Title [[section-title]]
....

It is optional to provide explicit section ids for the sections that are very unlikely to change their title, e.g. License.

[#section-anchors-abbreviations]
==== Section Anchors Abbreviations

Feel free to abbreviate section anchors.

....
# good
[#provide-toc]
=== Provide the Table of Contents
...

[#one-sentence-per-line]
=== One Sentence per Line [[ventilated-prose]]

Don’t wrap text at a fixed column width.
Instead, put each sentence on its own line, a technique called sentence per line.

....
# bad - the whole paragraph needs to be reformatted on edit
Prefix with `_` unused block parameters and local variables. It's also
acceptable to use just `_` (although it's a bit less descriptive). This
convention is recognized by the Ruby interpreter and tools like RuboCop and will
suppress their unused variable warnings.

# bad - line is too long
Prefix with `_` unused block parameters and local variables. It's also acceptable to use just `_` (although it's a bit less descriptive). This convention is recognized by the Ruby interpreter and tools like RuboCop and will suppress their unused variable warnings.

# good - none of the above
Prefix with `_` unused block parameters and local variables.
It's also acceptable to use just `_` (although it's a bit less descriptive).
This convention is recognized by the Ruby interpreter and tools like RuboCop and will suppress their unused variable warnings.
....

[#code-in-section-titles]
=== Code in Section Titles

Quote code in section titles with backticks.

....
# bad
[#no-and-or-or]
=== No and or or

# good
[#no-and-or-or]
=== No `and` or `or`
....

[#unnecessary-code-in-section-titles]
==== Except when it's Unnecessary

Omit backticks when they don't add semantic clarity.

....
# ok'ish
=== `Set` vs `Array`

# good
=== Set vs Array
....

[#use-ascii]
=== Use ASCII

Stick to ASCII character set unless absolutely necessary.

....
# bad
It’s “typographically” correct — but bad.

# good
It's "typographically" incorrect - but good.
....

....
# good
https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop[RuboCop], a static code analyzer (linter) and formatter, has a https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rails[`rubocop-rails`] extension, based on this style guide.
....

=== Tell How to Contribute
