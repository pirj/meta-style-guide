This Meta style guide outlines the recommended practices for style guide contributors.
When we say "style", we mean "consistency".

== Content [[content]]

____
Content is King

-- Bill Gates
____

=== Start with Why [[start-with-why]]

____
People don't buy what you do,
they buy why you do it.

-- Simon Sinek
____

Start with an explanation why the guide is important.

....
# bad
This Ruby style guide contains best practices for programming Ruby.

# good
This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby programmers.
....

=== Essentials [[essentials]]

Leave out obvious, rarely used, and arguable guidelines.

....
# bad
Do not keep newlines in the beginning of the file.

# good
End each file with a single newline.
....

=== Descriptive Section Titles [[descriptive-section-titles]]

Provide a descriptive and concise section title.
Avoid long titles.

....
# bad - hard to understand the point, too generic
=== Section Titles [[section-titles]]

# bad - overly verbose
=== Explanatory and Descriptive Section Titles [[explanatory-and-descriptive-section-titles]]

# good
=== Descriptive Section Titles [[descriptive-section-titles]]
....

=== Meaningful Descriptions [[meaningful-descriptions]]

Provide a concise, but comprehensive description.

....
# bad - not enough context
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.

# bad - excessively verbose
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes are intended to be instantiated and inherited from.
A service class is usually a functional unit that has an entry point, and the implementation is not important for consumers.
Dealing with the redundant necessity to instantiate a service class adds boilerplate to consumer code.

# good
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes should be used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.
....

=== Good, OK'ish and Bad Examples [[good-ok-ish-and-bad-examples]]

Provide good, and bad examples for the guideline.
Give enough context, but keep to the point.

==== Good Bad Examples [[good-bad-examples]]

Don't make a bad example horrible.
Let it adhere to the other guidelines to highlight how it breaks the guideline in question.

....
# bad bad - bad by all means
==== Secktion taitl case

# good bad - just bad from title case standpoint
==== Section title case [[section-title-case]]
....

==== Example Annotation [[example-annotation]]

Provide example annotation if the example is not obvious.

....
# bad - too verbose
...

# ok'ish - short, but comprehensive
...

# good - enough context to understand the implications
...
....

=== Options [[options]]

Provide options when there is more than one acceptable way.

....
# good
=== Consistent Multi-line Chains [[consistent-multi-line-chains]]

Adopt a consistent multi-line method chaining style.
There are two popular styles in the Ruby community, both of which are considered good - leading `.`  and trailing `.`.

==== Leading `.` [[leading-dot-in-multi-line-chains]]

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line keep the `.` on the second line.

==== Trailing `.` [[trailing-dot-in-multi-line-chains]]

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line, include the `.` on the first line to indicate that the expression continues.
....

=== Context [[context]]

Provide necessary context, sources, links to discussions.

=== Up to Date [[up-to-date]]

Keep the guide up to date.
Do not keep obsolete guidelines just for historical reasons.

=== Regarded Sources [[regarded-sources]]

Iconic books on the subject of the guide are the best source of guidelines.

Established practices is another.
Consult popular source code of mature projects, e.g. https://github.com/jeromedalbert/real-world-ruby-apps/[Real World Ruby apps] and https://github.com/eliotsykes/real-world-rails/[Real World Rails apps].
Make sure to use recent stable versions.

=== External Content [[external-content]]

Do not rely on external content.
Keep important information in the guide itself.

....
# bad
Refer to https://www.geocities.com/ironhorse/ruby-multi-line-chains.html[this blog post] for more information.

# good
Leading dot style may result in surprising behavior when the code is pasted in IRB.
....

=== Keep it Tidy [[keep-it-tidy]]

It's OK to have discussions in progress.
However, if there's no consensus, and discussions lead nowhere, close the pull request/issue.
Probably it's not something super important.
It's unlikely that it will ever be handled.

== Layout [[layout]]

=== Provide the Table of Contents [[provide-toc]]

TODO

=== Group the Guidelines

Group the guidelines into logically related sections.

=== Order by Importance [[order-by-importance]]

TODO

=== Cooperation [[cooperation]]

== Formatting and Wording [[formatting-and-wording]]

=== Use Proper Terms [user-proper-terms]]

# bad
Recommendation


# good
Guideline
....

=== Use Proper English

TODO

=== Section Title Case [[section-title-case]]

Section titles should normally adhere to title case.

....
# bad - not all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs are capitalized
=== Provide the table of contents [[provide-toc]]

# bad - conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are capitalized
=== Provide The Table If Contents [[provide-toc]]

# good

=== One Sentence per Line [[ventilated-prose]] [[one-sentence-per-line]]

TODO

https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line
    less churn

TODO: descr

....
# bad

=== Evolution [[evolution]]

Mention that the guide is not set in stone, and is a living document.

=== Tool References [[tools-references]]

Provide a reference to corresponding static analysis tool if it exists.

....
# good
https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop[RuboCop], a static code analyzer (linter) and formatter, has a https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rails[`rubocop-rails`] extension, based on this style guide.
....

=== Tell How to Contribute [[tell-how-to-contribute]]

TODO

=== Spread the Word [[spread-the-word]]

Ask to spread the word about the guide.
A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that doesn't know about its existence.
