This Meta style guide outlines the recommended practices for style guide contributors.
When we say "style", we mean "consistency".

[#content]
== Content

____
Content is King

-- Bill Gates
____

[#start-with-why]
=== Start with Why

____
People don't buy what you do,
they buy why you do it.

-- Simon Sinek
____

Start with an explanation why the guide is important.

....
# bad
This Ruby style guide contains best practices for programming Ruby.

# good
This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby programmers.
....

[#essentials]
=== Essentials

Leave out obvious, rarely used, and arguable guidelines.

....
# bad
Do not keep newlines in the beginning of the file.

# good
End each file with a single newline.
....

[#descriptive-section-titles]
=== Descriptive Section Titles

Provide a descriptive and concise section title.
Avoid long titles.

....
# bad - hard to understand the point, too generic
=== Section Titles

# bad - overly verbose
=== Explanatory and Descriptive Section Titles

# good
=== Descriptive Section Titles
....

[#meaningful-descriptions]
=== Meaningful Descriptions

Provide a concise, but comprehensive description.

....
# bad - not enough context
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.

# bad - excessively verbose
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes are intended to be instantiated and inherited from.
A service class is usually a functional unit that has an entry point, and the implementation is not important for consumers.
Dealing with the redundant necessity to instantiate a service class adds boilerplate to consumer code.

# good
Prefer modules to classes with only class methods.
Classes should be used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.
....

[#good-ok-ish-and-bad-examples]
=== Good, OK'ish and Bad Examples

Provide good, and bad examples for the guideline.
Give enough context, but keep to the point.

TODO: ok'ish

[#good-bad-examples]
==== Good Bad Examples

Don't make a bad example horrible.
Let it adhere to the other guidelines to highlight how it breaks the guideline in question.

....
# bad bad - bad by all means
==== Secktion taitl case

# good bad - just bad from title case standpoint
[#section-title-case]
==== Section title case
....

[#example-annotation]
==== Example Annotation

Provide example annotation if the example is not obvious.

....
# bad - too verbose
...

# ok'ish - short, but comprehensive
...

# good - enough context to understand the implications
...
....

[#options]
=== Options

Provide options when there is more than one acceptable way.

....
# good
[#consistent-multi-line-chains]
=== Consistent Multi-line Chains

Adopt a consistent multi-line method chaining style.
There are two popular styles in the Ruby community, both of which are considered good - leading `.`  and trailing `.`.

[#leading-dot-in-multi-line-chains]
==== Leading `.`

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line keep the `.` on the second line.

[#trailing-dot-in-multi-line-chains]
==== Trailing `.`

When continuing a chained method invocation on another line, include the `.` on the first line to indicate that the expression continues.
....

[#context]
=== Context

Provide necessary context, sources, links to discussions.

[#up-to-date]
=== Up to Date

Keep the guide up to date.
Do not keep obsolete guidelines just for historical reasons.

[#regarded-sources]
=== Regarded Sources

Iconic books on the subject of the guide are the best source of guidelines.

Established practices is another.
Consult popular source code of mature projects, e.g. https://github.com/jeromedalbert/real-world-ruby-apps/[Real World Ruby apps] and https://github.com/eliotsykes/real-world-rails/[Real World Rails apps].
Make sure to use recent stable versions.

[#external-content]
=== External Content

Do not rely on external content.
Keep important information in the guide itself.

....
# bad
Refer to https://www.geocities.com/ironhorse/ruby-multi-line-chains.html[this blog post] for more information.

# good
Leading dot style may result in surprising behavior when the code is pasted in IRB.
....

[#keep-it-tidy]
=== Keep it Tidy

It's OK to have discussions in progress.
However, if there's no consensus, and discussions lead nowhere, close the pull request/issue.
Probably it's not something super important.
It's unlikely that it will ever be handled.
